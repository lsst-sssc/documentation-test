    "[LSST's Data Preview v0.2](https://dp0-2.lsst.io/) is simulation of 300 deg2 of sky, observed with an LSST-like camera and cadence.  Solar system objects are not included in the simulated DP0.2 data, but one can still search the DP0.2 metadata for coverage of a their ephemerides.  This document serves as a resource to share information on those targets."
